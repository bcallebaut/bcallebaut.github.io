## The Hardware

The STM32 is a [broad family](https://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers-microprocessors.html) of ARM Cortex M based microcontroller.

The family is divided in the following main categories
 -  The High Performance tier
 -  The Mainstream tier
 -  The Ultra Low Power tier
 -  The Wireless tier

We are focusing ourselve on the STM32L4 for which exist a bunch of evaluation boards.
The one I am going to describe more in detail the STM32L4A6ZG.
It has the following characteristics:
>
 - Cortex M4 80 MHz
 - 1 MByte Flash
 - 320 kByte SRAM
 - USB OTG
 - LCD
 - __AES-256__
 - DFSDM

You can find more details about this microcontroller on the product page [here](https://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers-microprocessors/stm32l4a6zg.html)

The best way to start thinkering with such a board is alway to start with a development board. In our case, the [NUCLEO-L4A6ZG](https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/evaluation-tools/product-evaluation-tools/mcu-mpu-eval-tools/stm32-mcu-mpu-eval-tools/stm32-nucleo-boards/nucleo-l4a6zg.html).
It is based on the STM32L4A6ZG, a 144 pin microntroller version with hardware cryptographic acceleration.

It cost 18.62 $ (No VAT and no shipping cost included).

As you can see on the top of the image, it has an embedded ST-LINK debugger/programmer. Second nice thing about it is that this ST-LINK can be used with other boards. Remove the jumpers on the CN4 header and you disconnect the Nucleo board from the ST-LINK.

## The Software

You have several choices for the IDE :
 - [MBED Studio](https://os.mbed.com/studio/) : This board is not MBed enabled, so it could not run out of the box
 - STM32cubeIDE

You can also choose use Windows, Linux or MACos to run your preferred IDE.

Personnally I always develop under Linux. It is free and is the reference platform for all the toolchains and build tools. In this case Windows and MacOs use ports of those tools with all the small issues you can have with non-native tools. 

I choose to use STM32CubeIDE as MBed Studio doesn't run under Linux.

### STM32CubeIDE

It is a nice IDE built on top of [Eclipse CDT](https://www.eclipse.org) like a lot of IDEs today (FYI: The [Microchip](https://microchip.com) IDE is based on [Netbeans](https://netbeans.apache.org)).
It provides on top of the C/C++ development, the following features:
 - Microcontroller selection and configuration
 - Off the Self support for ST-LINK debug probes (the one used with Nucleo boards)

I won't go in the details of it as most of its functionalities are based on standard Eclipse framework and as such work in the same way.

###STM32CubeProgrammer
THis is an interesting tool not integrated withe the IDE.

It allows you to erase,program, and view the content of the flash of the microcontroller. It allows you also to set the options bits of the microcontroller (more about it in another post)

It is base on JavaFX, so expect more fancy UI than the STM32CubeIDE.

### Conclusion
After an easy installation , the tools work pretty well. As always, the creation of Menu entries is not perfect (Not a the correct palce for the STM32CubeProgrammer).

You have also to take into account that there could be something already running on the board, so connection issues using a software reset may happen. Don't hesitate to force an hardware reset.

Connection and debugging work out of the box. Keep in mind that the STM32CubeIDE is a new IDE and as such many of the demo projects for the boards are still made for the previous IDE (System Workbench for STM32...)
This is not an issue because there is a builtin import tool for those projects working without issues for me.
