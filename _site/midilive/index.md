# Midi Live Manager

## From a Midi controller to a music production manager

The Midi Live Manager is a midi controller but its is also a lot more. It is also your communication hub for midi infromation and an open platform that allows you to load the functionality you need.
On top of standard functions like midi sequencer and loop controller, it opens up a whole new range of possibilites. 

All of these functions fits in a nice looking slim rackable box that can fit either on your desk or on your home studio shelf.

**Dream it and it can do it**

## Rock Solid standard functions

The front panel gives you access to a wide range of of common functions thrgough multi-functions buttons as well as vast amount of advanced functions through its oled display and navigation panel.

### The sequencer
16 tracks sequencer with record/forward buttons for easy. Packed also with beat leds 

### The display
Bright OLED display with a navigation panel for easy menu navigation.

It give access to a wide range of menus and allows you to reconfigure on the fly the functions.

### The presets panel
A set of 10 buttons giving you access to your preferred presets


## Communicates without limits

### Midi
*    2 MIDI IN  : Record your Live performance from your synths or your sequencer
*    4 MIDI OUT : Control your external synthetizers and sound modules
*    3 foot switches : control functions like loops, effects and more

### Communication
*    1 USB Host port : Save and load your work or control slave sound interfaces right from the box
*    1 USB Device port : Make it an extension of your computer
*    1 Micro SD card : Small yet large storage capacity
*    1 Ethernet port : We are talking about communication,so lets do it.

## Open and Hacker ready.
The box itself is fully open and can be expanded using software plugins or hardware boards.

### Plugins
The open API gives you the possibility to personnalize the function:
*    Unhappy with the sequencer ? Replace it with your plugin
*    Want audio recording capabilities ? Add a multitrack control panel
*    Complex score snippets ? Automate the transitions and overlays
*    Want more ? Just dream it

### The hardware
There is room inside for extension boards. You have access to digital audio and midi ports directly from the internal expansion header.

It allows you to hack things like:
*    Effect box
*    Synthetizer
*    recording
*    ...

## Status
The project is in pre alpha stage.

I am currently doing the electronic design an brainstorming on a look for the box itself
