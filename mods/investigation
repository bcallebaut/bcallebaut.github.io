The investigation goes along several axes :
 - __Hardware__ : which components are good candidates to be part of the final product
 - __Software__ : Which software building blocks (Operating Systems, Libraries...) are good candidates for the final product.
 - __Application__ : Which kind of applications are a good fit for the final product(s)
 - __Tooling__ : Which tools to use in order to support the project

# Hardware

## Microcontroller
According to the [requirement document](requirements.md) and the [architecture document](architecture.md) the microcontroller are divided in to the following categories,
each one with specific requirements.

### IO and Communication
 - LCD panel Interface
 - HDMI interface
 - USB 2.0/3.0 Host interface
 - USB 2.0/3.0 device interface
 - Ethernet 100MBit/1GBit
 - Capacitive touch capability
 - SDHC/SDIO

  These microcontroller don't process sensitive data. As such tampering is not a big deal.
  It will alter the functionality of the module but no critical data will be breached.

  - Microchip SAM3/SAM4 microcontroller are good candidates as they support capacitive touch. PIC32 are also potential candidates. Extensive documentation exist for capacitive sensing
  - MSP430 from TI are also a good candidate
  - NXP Kietis KE1SZ are also candidates.
  - STMicroelectronics STM32 support also Capacitive touch

### Audio/midi data routers
  - High Number of serial port (MIDI ports)
  - High number of I2S port

   In this category, the following processors are good candidates:
   - NXP LPC 558x, LPC55S6X
   - Microchip PIC32MFDA, SAME5

### Audio processors
  - DSP functionality
  - High MIPS/FLOP
  - UART
  - Audio Interfaces (I2S/McASP)

  Good Candidates are :
  - TI DSP TMS320C67xx
  - TI DSP  66K2G12
  - TI AM3358/ OSD3558
  - Octavo systems OSD32MP15x
