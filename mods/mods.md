# The Concept

# [History](./history.md)
Fitst, history began with analogic circuits like VCO, VCA and VCF. THis is the era of modular synthetizers like the [Moog](https://www.moogmusic.com/)

Beginning og the 1980 years, digital circuits appeared and soved the issues of circuit stability of the early synthetizers.

Those synthetizers were limited but quickly expannded in functionality. They are also a lot cheaper to produce.

THeir evoliution follows the evolution of computers with first specialized circuits, later on digital signal processors and finally now with powerful processors.

This evolution led to the computer era where the synthetizers are now emulated on computers and even on tablets.
THese synthetizers allows the user to carry a vast range of sounds in a tiny form factor but they don't provide the same level of realtime control 
which is important for high quality production and complex live performance.
