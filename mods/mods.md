title: Modular Open Digital System (MODS)
---
  ![Arrow](../arrow_right.png) __MODS__ , the first maker friendly digital synthetizer platform 

MODS is :
  - Open modular platform for __makers__ : play with it, improve it. it made for it
  - Personal instrument : Put in it what you need, create with it what you want
  - Your best music buddy : You are the __creative guy__ and it is taking care of the chores 

# Your Music Buddy
Its primary role is to manage things in background, be it music tracks, mixes, sounds banks and more while giving you quick access to the key drivers you need.

 - Need to replay a groove on stage ? It is one click away.
 - Need to recall a particular sound bank ? Again one click away.
 - Need a Digital Audio Workstation, it has all the building block to make your preferred one.

 - Bye Bye truckloads of music gear. This box is filled with all the horsepower you need.

# Your own instrument
  From a simple smart midi controller and sequencer to a complex music production gear,
  from a sleek box to a knobs and slider packed panel.

  You decide what you want it to be.

# Open Modular Platform
Powers is in your hands like for any open platform.
You can choose from a wide range of modules, both purely software or hardware.
You plug them in, let the system manage them you are ready to use them directly.

You didn't find the module fitting your needs ?  No worry you can make your own.

A extensive documentation and specification for both software guys and hardware guys are available to kickstart your developments

# [The technology](./technology.md)
Engineers thinkered for years and a lot of good innovation came out from them:
 - [Eurorack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurorack) system allowing musicians to build their own analog synths.
 - Digital signal processors, the heart of many modern synthetizers.
 - Internet of Things and single board computers
 - Audio plugin systems like VST
 - Music oriented Open Source projects like [Ardour](https://ardour.org/), [Rosegarden](https://www.rosegardenmusic.com/)...

# The project
The project mixes hardware and software and involves several phases overlapping in time:
 - __[Investigation phase](investigation.md)__ : which existing software or hardware component can be used in the project ?
 - __[Product definition](definition.md)__ : What will the product exactly do or nor ? For which people ?
 - __[Prototyping](prototyping.md)__ : Create minimal version of the needed functionalities.
 - __[Gather team](team.md)__ : A big project requires a big team
 - __[Community of clients](community.md)__ : Making products is great but you make them  not only for you but for other people too.

These phases are supported by the following support information
 - __[Requirements](requirements.md)__ : What functionalities must be implemented by the product(s)
 - __[Architecture](architecture.md)__ : Defines conceptually the structure and the behavior of the products
 - __[Design](design.md)__ : Defines in details how the products are builts in order to implement the required behavior
 - __[Project Policies](policies.md)__ : Defines the workflows in the project

Don't worry if it looks over complicated. It is not. Such details are useful in order to share a complete vision about the project and allows everybody to
collaborate without having anybody keeping knowledge "hidden".

# [History](./history.md)
First, history began with analogic circuits like VCO, VCA and VCF. THis is the era of modular synthetizers like the [Moog](https://www.moogmusic.com/) and later to the [Eurorack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurorack) system

Beginning og the 1980 years, digital circuits appeared and solved the issues of circuit stability of the early synthetizers.

Those synthetizers were limited but quickly expanded in functionality. They are also a lot cheaper to produce.

Their evolution follows the evolution of computers with first specialized circuits, later on digital signal processors and finally now with powerful processors.

This evolution led to the computer era where the synthetizers are now emulated on computers and even on tablets.
THese synthetizers allows the user to carry a vast range of sounds in a tiny form factor but they don't provide the same level of real time control 
which is important for high quality production and complex live performance.
